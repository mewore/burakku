~~Yes, I used the age-old tactic of butchering a foreign word so that I don't have to deal with the fact that the name "
Blacklight" is already taken.~~

## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea
    - **Base genre:** puzzle, platformer
    - Basically Fireboy and Watergirl, but with one catch - ~~Fireboy~~ Blacklight radiates ultraviolet light and
